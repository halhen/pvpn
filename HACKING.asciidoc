HACKING
=======

HOMEPAGE
--------

The master source code repository, bug tracking, etc for  _pvpn_ is
https://www.github.com/halhen/pvpn. Please report issues here, or to
henrik@k2h.se.


CONTRIBUTING
------------
* To contribute, send a patch as a github pull request or using
  +git format-patch+ to henrik@k2h.se.
* Keep your patches atomic and complete. Remember documentation.
* Add yourself to _AUTHORS_.
* Unless you have a good reason to, rebase your changes to the latest
  master before submitting.
* Spend an extra minute to write a proper commit message
** Describe the effect of the patch, rather than the contents.
** Use imperative form (e.g. +Change foo+ rather than +Changed foo+)
** Reference the issue (+#NNN+ or, if fixed, +fixes #NNN+) if
   applicable.
** Max 50 characters in the title.
** Max 72 characters wide lines.

Don't be discouraged or annoyed if I ask you to change your patch before
I accept it. The reason is probably that I have not been specific enough
about how I would like patches to be.
